  \section{Introduction}

  \begin{figure}
    \plotone{../results/static/cost.eps}
    \caption{This is the caption of a figure that is not generated on the fly. We should place these papers in \texttt{results/static}. These might include figures that we did not generate ourselves or figures that take too long to build automatically.}

  \section{Methodology}

  \begin{figure}
    \plotone{../results/sample_math_plot.pdf}
    \caption{This is a figure that is generated on the fly by a Jupyter notebook using \texttt{nbflow}.}

  \section{Results}

# Inference of Heating Properties from "Hot" Non-flaring Plasmas. II. Nanoflare Trains

This repository holds all of the text, analysis code, and figures related to [Barnes et al. (2016)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/833/2/217).
The accompanying notebooks provide details as to how to remake the figures.
However, at this point in time, regenerating all of the data for this paper may prove difficult.

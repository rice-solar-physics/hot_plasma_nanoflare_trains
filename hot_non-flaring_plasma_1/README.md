# Hot Non-flaring Plasma in Active Regions I

Text and figures for first paper on hot non-flaring plasma in ARs studied using 0D 
hydrodynamics.

##Table
Table summarizing hot plasma results similar to that shown in Bradshaw et al. (2012) for cool emission measure slopes. This may be a bit of a challenge as few authors actually report hot emission measure slopes.

##Figures

+ __Fig 1__ Single fluid, T, n (1 panel each) for 4 heating durations.

+ __Fig 2__ 2-fluid. Electron and ion heating. 2 panels for (say) two heating times, 200 and 40 s. One has `T_e` and `T_i` for both electron and ion heating, the other n,

  + In these Figures, we get across the point that the T-n behaviour below the point of maximum emission measure has lost almost all information about the heating. Then we can show EM(T) only in the high-T region for the rest of the paper which makes the details clearer.

+ __Fig 3__ EM(T) for Single fluid, 4 heating cases.

+ __Fig 4__ EM(T) Parameter variation. Flux limiter. Single fluid (does it make any difference with electron heating? I suspect not). Include cases of varying `h_0`? Or do 2 panels as you suggest: flux limiter and then `H_0`. And L? Perhaps a 4-panel figure? of all these things

+ __Fig 5__ EM(T) for 2 fluid cases. 2 heating times, proton and e heating with single fluid for comparison? Again could be 2 panels for different heating durations, with more information on each panel.

  + At this stage, the time profiles are all shown before the emission measure. We could just as easily do single fluid (time profiles + EM) before 2-fluid.

+ __Fig 6__ `T_eff` bit. T, `T_eff` vs time for 2 cases say (short and long heating: 2 panels). Show `T_e`, `T_eff`, `T_i` for each. DOn't need density: shown earlier.

+ __Fig 7__ EM including T_eff. We could have 4 panels here, single fluid, ions, electron heating, EM(T) and EM(`T_eff`) on each. That's in fact 3, so could use 4th for parameter study.

# Hot Non-flaring Plasma in Active Regions I

Text and figures for first paper on hot non-flaring plasma in ARs studied using 0D 
hydrodynamics.

##Table
Table summarizing hot plasma results similar to that shown in Bradshaw et al. (2012) for cool emission measure slopes. This may be a bit of a challenge as few authors actually report hot emission measure slopes. 

Format: (Author) (Slope) (Observation or Model) (Temperature range) (Comments)

+ Caspi et al. (2015)--fit DEM model with b~6, temperature range unclear

+ Warren et al. (2012)--survey of many AR cores, fitting both hot and cool sides; _b_ ranged from 6-10 with large uncertainties.

## Direction

So now the paper will address how the presence of hot plasma can be affected by the following:

+ Pulse duration
+ Heat flux limiting
+ Electron versus ion heating
+ Non-equilibrium ionization

The first point includes how the increase in density in EBTEL might affect the EM results.

##Figures

+ __Fig. 1__: T(t) and n(t) for EBTEL and HYDRAD for tau=20,40,200,500 s
+ __Fig. 2__: EM(T) for EBTEL and HYDRAD for tau=20,40,200,500 s
+ __Fig. 3__: EM(T) for Spitzer, f=1/6, and f=1/30 conduction (tau=200 s)
+ __Fig. 4__: T(t) and n(t) for two-fluid EBTEL results for both electron and ion heating; unsure of which pulse durations should be used here
+ __Fig. 5__: EM(T) for two-fluid EBTEL results, electron and ion heating (include NEI EM here?)
+ __Fig. 6__: T(t) and n(t) for NEI runs, compare with two-fluid electron and ion heating results
+ __Fig. A1__: conduction, radiation, and equilibration terms for fixed tau for a single two-fluid EBTEL run

We thank the referee for these comments. We have made appropriate changes to the 2nd paragraph, as described below.

> _This paper looks at an important question namely the properties of emission expected from nanoflare heating in non-flaring active region cores. One of the aim of the work is to propose some tentative metrics that may be used to infer the effect of nanoflare heating on the distribution of emission measure vs temperature. The paper is well written and the method is set out clearly. I recommend publication of the paper._

> _I have one main comment: The authors propose to calculate the ratio between the emission measure at a pair of temperatures above and below the temperature of peak emission measure. This approach is interesting and it seems to be very promising. However I think that the authors should warn the reader about the difficulties in deriving a reliable EM(T) distribution from the analysis of the data and the uncertainties that may affect the determination of emission measure at the various temperatures._

We agree with this. We did reference two papers in the Introduction, but the issue does deserve more emphasis. We have added a note of some of the concerns as well as referenced the most comprehensive recent paper ([Guennou et al. 2013][guennou_2013]) at the start of Section 3.3.2. 

> _In my opinion, the result obtained by considering just a pair of temperatures may strongly reflect the above uncertainties when analyzing solar data. For this reason, I would suggest to consider a few more pairs of temperature to explore how the ratio depends on the choice of temperatures. In the case of true data, using two or more pairs of temperatures may reduce the effects of uncertainties on the result._

The aim of the temperature pair discussion was to follow on from the work of [Brosius et al. (2014)][brosius_2014] and introduce this idea, which could then be developed further in the future, rather than present an in depth discussion here. The generic shape of the expected EM(_T_) curve makes (in principle) the discussion of varying peak line formation temperatures quite straightforward, though the details are more complicated at the transition between low- and high-frequency nanoflares (the intermediate regime).

In response to the referee’s concern, we have now examined two “hot” and two “cool” temperatures that correspond to Fe XII, Fe XV, Fe XIX and Fe XX, giving four emission measure ratios. The results are as one would expect: for a fixed cool line, the ratio EM(hot)/EM(cool) decreases as one looks at a hotter “hot” line. A similar conclusion holds for a fixed hot line. The ratio increases from smallest to largest according to: Fe XX/Fe XV, Fe XIX/Fe XV, Fe XX/Fe XII, Fe XIX/Fe XII and this approach could be extended to other hot lines such as Fe XVIII. These results are summarized in an additional section (3.3.3) and an accompanying figure (Fig. 11).

The previous general conclusions hold over these other pairs. We expect to see a ratio of hot to cold between 0.2 and 1.5 depending on the line pair, and the different pairs predict different ratios. As before, it seems unlikely that information about t<sub>n</sub> can be obtained, although of course that _can_ be obtained from the low temperature part of EM(T), as we have discussed both here and in [Cargill (2014)][cargill_2014]. The conclusion remains that a range of line pairs can be used to detect the presence of hot plasma, but other techniques need to be developed to extract further details such as relative heating of species.

# Hot Non-Flaring Plasma in Active Regions II

## Outline
One potential outline for this paper, revised.

1. Introduction
 - Briefly discuss nanoflares, hot plasma
 - Talk about heating frequency (main point in intro)
 - Review (briefly) past studies of nanoflare trains, heating frequency versus steady heating
 - Emission measure slope diagnostic: hot side and cool side
 - Summarize main points
2. Methodology
 1. Numerical Model
  - Some comments about loop models
  - EBTEL
  - Two-fluid EBTEL, refer to Paper 1 for details
 2. Energy Budget
  - Talk about heating function we will use (b.g. + triangular pulses)
  - Justify time-averaged heating rate
  - Sample calculation to show consistency with nanoflare energies
 3. Heating Statistics (maybe combine with 2.2?)
  - Power-law versus uniform
  - Discuss scaling between waiting time and event energy
  - Use of many runs to accurately represent distribution, capture hot shoulder dynamics
3. Results
 - Parameters used in all runs (pulse duration, total time, loop length, etc.)
 - Emission measure distribution details
 - Fitting details
 - Sample MC EM curves
 1. Separate electron and ion heating
 2. Single-fluid comparison
 3. Full parameter space comparison
4. Discussion
5. Conclusions
